# Design Inspiration Hub

This repository contains the **Design Inspiration Hub**, a simple web page that links to various design resources. The goal is to provide a quick gateway to popular illustration and UI inspiration sites using a clean Tailwind CSS layout.

## Editing `index.html`

1. Open `index.html` in your favourite text editor (for example VS Code, Vim or Notepad).
2. Modify the HTML as needed and save the file.
3. Open the file in a web browser to preview your changes.

## Tailwind via CDN

The page loads Tailwind CSS directly from the official CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

No additional build steps are required; the styles will be pulled from the CDN when the page loads.

## Background Image

The current background image reference is `a6e349a38881cd797a5bddaba6495c9b.jpeg`. Replace it with your own image or add the missing file to ensure the background displays correctly.
